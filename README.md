# Multistage Classification for Statement Justification

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the work presented in the [Political Fake Statement Detection via Multistage Feature-assisted Neural Modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9280531). The original ideas and methodologies were developed by the authors of the paper, and I have built upon their work.

## Features
- **Original Implementation**: The foundational work based on the "Political Fake Statement Detection via Multistage Feature-assisted Neural Modeling".


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harshbari-153/Multistage-Classification-for-Statement-Justification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Multistage-Classification-for-Statement-Justification
    ```

## Acknowledgements
This project is heavily based on the work presented in the [Political Fake Statement Detection via Multistage Feature-assisted Neural Modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9280531). The original concepts and methodologies were conceived by the authors of the paper. This implementation includes additional enhancements and improvements to make the process more robust and user-friendly.
